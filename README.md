# About me
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jimmy!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently a Sr Technical Program Manager in a media technology organization. 
- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ I'm also a big Politics nerd. 

After being in project and program management for about 9 years, I decided that I wanted to learn to write code too! So in 2021, I took two nanodegree programs offered by Udacity.  Since then, I have continued to learn and grow my skills. I really like maps and elections data, so that's been the playground I've been playing in for a bit.

# About my code

## State Legislature Party Composition

In this project, I wanted to represent how each state's legislature was composed by party. To accomplish this, I needed to build a python machine to fetch, aggregate, and shape the data from several disparate APIs into a single JSON file. I then built a web page using svelte that is powered by this single JSON file/feed. Check out the front end representation of this data <a href= "https://jrd-primary-public.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">here</a>. You can explore the code in <a href="https://github.com/jimmydaleucf/ga-legislature.git">this repo</a>

## Cobb County Elections Results

<a href="https://cobb-election-2018.netlify.app/">Here's a site that I built</a> to continue developing my skills . It is built using Svelte and leverages the publicly exposed APIs that power the Georgia Secratary of State's Results Dashboards.  The responses in those api's aren't in a form that is easily used for my needs, so I included some JS code to transform the data into a more usable format.
